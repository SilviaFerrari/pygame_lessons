## 💢 I need more sprites!

If you're developing your own video game, probably you'll to need other characters, items and more.<br />
Graphics in video games it's a very **onerous job** and I won't recommend doing it completely by your self.<br />
The best thing you can do is use sprites and backgrounds already made by some underpaid artist.

"So, where can I find them, without creating from scratch?"<br />

Short answer: on Google.<br />
Long answer: you have multiple options:

1. Search on popular art sites like **Pinterest** or **DeviantArt**.

2. Just type on Google **'-subject- pixel art'** and do a little search.

"Ok, but i need images with transparent backgrounds and there's almost nothing around!"<br />
Well yes, that sucks, but it'easily resolvable. Just follow these steps:

1. Choose an image with a **plain or solid background**.

2. Copy or download it and go on [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/).

3. Load the image and remove the backgrund with the **"magic wand" tool**.

4. Don't forget to **crop the image** till the border!

5. Export the new file as **".png"**.
